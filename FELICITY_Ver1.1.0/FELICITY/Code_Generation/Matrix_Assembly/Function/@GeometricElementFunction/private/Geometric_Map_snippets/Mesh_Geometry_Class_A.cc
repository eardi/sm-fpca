============================================================================================
   This class accesses the mesh geometry data and computes the local transformation from
   the reference element to a `general' element in the mesh.
   
   Several things are computed, such as the gradient of the transformation and Jacobian,
   as well as many other ``custom items''.
   
   This code references the header files:
   
   matrix_vector_defn.h
   matrix_vector_ops.h

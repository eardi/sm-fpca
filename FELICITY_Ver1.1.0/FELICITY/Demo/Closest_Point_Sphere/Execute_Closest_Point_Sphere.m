% note: this method of computing the closest point is only first order accurate.
% this is because the accuracy is essentially limited by how accurate the normal vector is
% approximated by the surface mesh.  In this case, the surface mesh is piecewise linear,
% so the normal vector is only first order accurate.

% GX = [1, 0.4, 0.9;
%       -0.8, -0.7, -1];
% note: if one of the points is at the origin, then the MAX_ERROR (below) will be large.
%       This is because all of the points on the sphere are equidistant to the origin
%       so there is no unique closest point.  The point searching code will find one of
%       the surface mesh points (i.e. it will converge), but it does not make sense to
%       compare it to the "true" value because there is no unique true value.

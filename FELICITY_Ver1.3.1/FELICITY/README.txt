DESCRIPTION
========================================================================

This code implements mesh manipulation and refinement, generic finite element matrix assembly for problems in 1D, 2D, and 3D, interpolation of finite element data, as well as some other tools.  See the accompanying FELICITY.pdf and Quickref.pdf files for more info.

USAGE
========================================================================

0. Download the package from:  http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/31141-felicity

1. Extract the given .zip file and read the "FELICITY.pdf" file for more info.  In particular, see the INSTALLATION instructions in Chapter 1 of the PDF file.

2. You need a C++ compiler. I use MS Visual C++, express edition.  If you use LINUX, then the gcc compiler should be fine.  You can configure MATLAB to use a compatible C++ compiler by typing "mex -setup" at the MATLAB prompt.

3. Check the manual for tutorials, as well as GitHub:

http://github.com/walkersw/felicity-finite-element-toolbox/wiki

4. Type "FELICITY_user_help" at the MATLAB prompt for info on useful classes within FELICITY.
Look in the "Demo" directories for examples of how to use FELICITY.  Also, check out the quick refernce guide: Quickref.pdf.

There is also a google group:

5. Warning!  Make sure that the meshes you use are positively oriented, e.g. make sure edge, triangle, and tetrahedra connectivity lists are positively oriented (i.e. right-hand-rule).  If you do not know what this means, then you should not use this toolbox!


COMPATIBILITY NOTES
========================================================================
The tool was developed in its current form with R2018a.

You need the MATLAB Symbolic Math Toolbox to use FELICITY.
You need a C++ compiler that MATLAB can use with its "mex" command.


Tested on these systems:

-- Windows 10, 64-bit
Fully functional with R2018a, R2020a

-- LINUX KDE/Ubuntu, 64-bit
Fully functional with R2019a.

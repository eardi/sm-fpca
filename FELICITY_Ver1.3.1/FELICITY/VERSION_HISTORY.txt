
-----------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.3.1   (25 June 2020) - Added ability to not use symbolic computing toolbox in "ReferenceFiniteElement"; this is useful when running *pre-generated* code on a machine with the toolbox, then copying stuff to a machine without the toolbox.  Added ability in TIGER mesh generator (3-D) to have the background grid be an exact cube (instead of jagged).  Various minor bug fixes.

Version 1.3.0   (16 May  2019) - Added H(div) functionality on 2-D surfaces embedded in 3-D.  Enabled matrix-valued basis and coefficient functions.  Various small interface improvements.  Add initial functionality for assembling matrices over subsets of elements.  Restructured unit tests. The unit tests are no longer in the Matlab path.  So, if you want to run a specific unit test, then you must change into that unit test's directory to run it.

Version 1.2.7   (21 Mar  2018) - Fixed minor bug in unit test with symbolic functions.  Fixed another bug in unit test with newer version of Matlab.

Version 1.2.6   (14 Feb  2018) - Fixed minor bug with matching variable names (strings) (this is in the code generation).  Added functionality for symbolic constants in auto code gen for matrix assembly code and interpolation, i.e. these constants are specified at runtime by being provided by the user when calling the MEX file.  Cleaned up the interface to the TIGER mesh generator.  Other minor bug fixes.

Version 1.2.5   (06 Dec  2017) - Added functionality to make DoF allocation code more automatic.  Cleaned up comments and two demos (for the FELICITY paper).

Changed the syntax of how to generate code for matrix assembly, interpolation, point searches, and DoF allocators (it is better now!).  Updated the manual and wiki to coincide.  Fixed a bug in the code generation when handling variables with similar names (e.g. "mu" versus "u").  Fixed bug between linux and windows when checking directories.

Version 1.2.0   (18 Nov  2016) - Added mesh element diameter routine to FELICITY Mesh classes.  Added FEM class for automating point searches on meshes.  Changed the m-file format for storing/defining a finite element.  Changed the way DoFs are allocated; the m-file format is now simpler and easier to understand.  Implemented H(curl) in 2-D and 3-D, with Nedelec 1st-kind elements plus unit tests.  Changed internal code generation for basis function transformations as well as interpolations.  Changed mesh class to use MATLAB's new "triangulation" class; some method names changed here.  Updated the manual and quickref.pdf to reflect these new changes.

Version 1.1.5   (16 June 2016) - Modified the C++ matrix assembly to be more efficient when lots of sub-matrices are present; this only modifies the internals of FELICITY.

Version 1.1.4   (08 June 2016) - Streamlined C++ matrix assembly-code (part 1).  This is the first step to implementing OpenMP for matrix assembly.

Version 0.95    (10 Jan  2015) - Fixed minor bugs; fixed tolerance in point search code.  Implemented the second derivative with respect to arc-length operator, and the hessian operator for functions defined on 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D domains. This includes curves and surfaces embedded in 3-D, i.e. the "surface hessian" is now implemented.  Also added the shape operator (e.g. the surface gradient of the normal vector on surfaces) to geometric functions defined on curved domains.  Updated the FEL_SaveLoad class and FEL_Visualize class.

Version 0.94    (05 Aug  2014) - Fixed warning message about "simple"; fixed bug when checking multi-linearity of forms.

Updated the PDF manual (and Google-Code page) to have new tutorials for using the point searcher.

Version 0.925   (11 June 2014) - You can now mix together geometric functions from different sub-domains, in a single integral, when auto generating code for matrix assembly.  Similarly, this also applies to auto generating interpolation routines.  Fixed and added some error checking.  Added a helper class for managing the saving and loading of indexed simulation data.  Added a generic abstract class (and template example) for running finite element simulations.  These are under the "./FELICITY/Classes/ManageSim/" directory.

This is useful for interpolation over finite element meshes.  They can be found in the sub-directory: "./FELICITY/Static_Codes/Search_Trees".

Version 0.915   (09 Aug  2013) - Moved the file "Get_Edge_Info_From_Triangles.m" into a method under the MeshTriangle class.  Reworked the DoF-Allocator code generator so that the generated MEX file is easier to use (i.e. you only need to supply the domain triangulation; no edges or neighbors are needed); generated code is also simpler.  Updated documentation to reflect new DoF allocation interface (also updated Google-Code page tutorials).  Added unit test for evaluating BDM1 on a co-dim 1 sub-domain.  Fixed some minor bugs with newer MATLAB versions.  Added some error checking to make sure bilinear and linear forms have properly formed integrand expressions.

Fixed minor bug related to orientation for non-H^1 functions.

Version 0.876   (10 Jan  2013) - Fixed a bug related to MATLAB not successfully copying files (b/c filenames are too long!).  The "test_FELICITY" script now checks for the root FELICITY path and warns you if the path name is too long (if so, then you should re-install in a directory that is not so deeply nested).  Also updated TIGER meshing interface, as well as the meshing tutorials on the Google-Code page.  Also included the INPOLYHEDRON.m file developed by Sven Holcombe.  Implemented other minor debugging and/or include extra error checking code.

Raviart-Thomas, lowest order, is implemented (RT0).  Adding more H(div) elements is straightforward.  Added unit tests for RT0.  Made other minor coding fixes related to code generation of basis function transformations.  Have started a Google-Code Project Hosting webpage; more info about how to use FELICITY will be posted there.

Version 0.831   (10 Feb  2012) - Fixed some small bugs, including one related to a missing file (minor).  This caused the FELICITY unit tests to crash.  NOTE to USERS: please email me if FELICITY does not work ``out of the box''!

Version 0.83    (21 Sept 2011) - Fully integrated the Rivara bisection algorithm into FELICITY (i.e. into the MeshTriangle class); it also manages subdomains throughout the bisection process.  Updated the documentation to have a tutorial on selective bisection of triangular meshes (also modified mesh tutorial on website).  Added a module for solving the Eikonal equation on triangular meshes.  Added appendix in the PDF manual that contains notes on how to do automatic code generation.  Fixed typos in documentation.

Version 0.82    (28 July 2011) - The documentation is now up-to-date.

Version 0.81    (27 July 2011) - Removed the .fml configuration file (was used for implementing matrix assembly code) and replaced it by an M-file script.  This allows for a better user interface and makes extension to tensor and mixed elements more straightforward (eventually...).  NOTE: the documentation still needs to be updated!

Version 0.797   (11 Mar  2011) - Intermediate release before FELICITY is broken to complete the implementation of assembly over sub-domains of co-dimension 1 (or 2).  This release should not affect anything on the user end.

Version 0.7965  (02 Mar  2011) - More code restructuring (especially with the code generation aspect).  Assembly over sub-domains of co-dimension 1 (or 2) is still NOT done.  This release should not affect anything on the user end.

Version 0.796   (22 Feb  2011) - Restructured the code to be more logical with respect to the Mesh Geometry and the FEM basis function transformation calculations.  This will make assembly over sub-domains of co-dimension 1 (or 2) easier.  This release should not affect anything on the user end.

Version 0.792   (08 Feb  2011) - Improved .fml file format with "Bilinear" and "Linear" forms.  Can also define "Real" (m x n) matrix such as for computing norms or averages of finite element functions.

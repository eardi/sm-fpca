Future Additions and Improvements to FELICITY
=============================================

I plan to add the following items to FELICITY (in no particular order).

* Adaptive h-refinement for 3-D tetrahedral meshes.  Mesh coarsening would also be desirable.
* Add more finite elements.
* Add functionality for Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods.
* Represent _mixed_ finite element spaces.
* Make a better mesh C++ class.
* Translate FELICITY to python.
* Add access to external (3rd party) solvers.
* Implement third derivative operators for basis functions and coefficient functions.
